4colors is a distraction-free, dark colorscheme for vim that only uses 4 colors. It's still work in progress, so feedback is appreciated.

The goals here are:

- minimalism - don't get distracted by a rainbow and focus on your coding
- easy customization - simply change the 4 colors
- terminal compatibility

The plugin also comes with a vim-airline theme, which is very lightweight.

## Installation

Install with your favorite plugin manager, or manually via:

    git clone https://github.com/mihaifm/4colors ~/.vim/pack/mybundle/start/

If you are using airline, add this to your vimrc:

    let g:airline_theme='4colors'
